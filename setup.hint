ldesc: "BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA plugins that generate bandlimited
sawtooth, square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves,
principally for use with one of the many modular software synthesisers
available. They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output
with harmonic content as high as possible over a wide pitch range."
